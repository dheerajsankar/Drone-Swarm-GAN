# Drone Swarm GAN Simulation

This project demonstrates how to use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to simulate data for a swarm of drones. It includes:
- Realistic generation of drone positions, speeds, and collision risks.
- A step-by-step guide to help you understand the implementation.

## Files
- `drone_swarm_simulation.py`: Python code for building and training the GAN.
- `Drone_Swarm_GAN_StepByStep.pdf`: Detailed guide to creating the GAN.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn
